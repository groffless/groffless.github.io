### Purpose of a README
--------------

Hello and welcome to my Markdown tutorial where we will look at the techniques and tools you can use with Markdown and later be able to use those tools and techniques to further your knowledge of how to properly write a Markdown. First of all, what is Markdown? Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is easy to read. It is like an easier version of writing HTML and used for many different things, most notably as an overview for a project.  Inside a project you will likely find a README.md file that includes documentation about their project, how to run it, if there are any bugs involved, etc. 


### Prerequisites
-------------
To start writing markdown you are going to need an editor. There are plenty of markdown editors you can easily find online for free such as Typora. I use Visual Studio Code, which is not necessarily the best for writing Markdown, but enough for what I need with its built-in features and extentions.

Before continuing you need to have some sort of basic knowledge of markdown. I suggest looking at one of the two markdown tutorials that can be found under [More Resources](#more-resources) towards the bottom of the page. 

Once you know a bit of how Markdown works you are ready to learn some recommendations of techniques you could use to improve your skills of using Markdown.  

When writing a markdown you want to think about your reader. You want you content to be discoverable, easy to find. If no one is reading your documentation, then who is it for? You are writing for your reader and no one else.


### Instructions
-------------

#### Hosting a Resume

Lets host a Resume using GitHub Pages.

__Step 1: Create a Resume__

Create a resume in markdown. If you already have a resume, convert it to markdown language.

The end goal we are wanting to accomplish is your resume in GitHub Pages.

Once you have your markdown file ready we can upload it to a static site generator such as GitHub Pages. Static sites are great in the fact that they are much easier to manage compared to your own website. Using static websites allows you to easily share your documentation with others. 


__Step 2: Create New Repository__

If you have not already logged in to GitHub, do so now. Alternatively you can do this under [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

1. Start by creating a new repository. 
- If you are on a browser go to "your repositories" under your profile. Next click on the green button labelled "New".
- Otherwise on the desktop you can create a new repository found under files (or by pressing ctrl + n).

In order to host your site on GitHub Pages you will need to be ___very specific___ with your repository name. 

2. Under repository name
- Write your GitHub username, followed by .github.io.

It should look something like this ``` groffless.github.io ```

3. Create the repository.

__Step 3: Add your files__

After creating your repository you will be inside your newly created repository. Now we are going to add your resume file.

1. Click on Add Files
2. Click Upload Files
3. Locate your RESUME.md file and add it to the repository

### Frequently Asked Questions
-------------

1. "Why is Markdown better than a word processor?"

Markdown is better than a word processor because it is more basic than your average word processor that has tons of features which most likely will require you to take your hands of the keyboard to use your mouse. You can just type whatever you need to without having to go up and manually select a size for a title or the type of font you use. Otherwise you are losing precious time that you could be using to write. 

2. "Why is my resume not showing up?"

It is possible that your GitHub Pages static website is still being generated. Sometimes it takes time for GitHub Pages to update. In the meantime go do something else while waiting for it to update. It could also be possible that GitHub is down for maintenance or some other reason meaning you will have to come back to it later.
